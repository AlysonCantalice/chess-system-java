# Workshop - Chess-System

This project was developed as a workshop during the *"Java COMPLETO 2023 Programação Orientada a Objetos + Projetos"* course by Professor Nelio Alves, available on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-curso-completo/).

For the best experience, you should play it in Git Bash by using *Git Bash here* in the `\bin\` directory and running the `Java application/Program` in its console. 

However, you can also play it in the Eclipse Console, keep in mind that it won't flush, which means there will be many "copies" of the board on the console.

# How to Play

Same rules as normal chess, when it's your turn, you can choose which piece you want to move by writing in the format LN (Letter Number), eg. 'h2'. Keep in mind that you can't play illegal moves, as you will be prompted to choose another one if there is another move available.

# Requirements

To run this project, it's necessary to have Java 17 (LTS) installed on your machine. The Java version I used was Java Azul Zulu 17.0.7 (LTS) ([link](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?version=java-17-lts&package=jdk#zulu)), but it should not be necessary to have this exact version for the project to work.

Furthermore, as these are source files (*src*), you also need an IDE capable of interpreting the code, with **ECLIPSE IDE** ([link](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)) being my choice.
